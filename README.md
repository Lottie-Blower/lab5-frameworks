## Overview

This lab explores the use of three popular UI frameworks: **Bootstrap**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React.js**. The objective was to understand and compare styling approaches using both utility-first (Tailwind) and component-based (Bootstrap) methodologies, and to create a simple interactive component using React.js.

The project is divided into three main parts:



## Part 1 – Bootstrap Layout

In the `bootstrap-demo` folder, I created a basic web page using only Bootstrap components. It has:
- A simple navbar
- A two-column layout
- A styled button and alert

I used Bootstrap 5.3 via CDN, so no custom CSS at all. It was pretty straightforward 
— Bootstrap makes it super easy to build something decent quickly.


## Part 2 – Tailwind CSS Layout

In `tailwind-demo`, I made a responsive card-style section using Tailwind CSS (also via CDN). It has:
- An image
- A headline
- Some text
- A nice button

Tailwind felt different from Bootstrap :
— more flexible and customizable, once I got used to all the utility classes. 
  It gave me more creative freedom.


## Part 3 – React Interactive Component

This one lives in `react-demo`. I used React and:
- Displayed a welcome message using props
- Added a button that toggles a message on/off using `useState()`
- Gave it a beautiful background and made sure the layout looked clean

Working with React was fun and gave me a good intro into how state and components work.
